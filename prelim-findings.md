## Top-level findings
**_PLEASE NOTE: These findings are preliminary and still subject to review and change._**

Based on our preliminary analysis so far, it appears voters in poor and rural counties have been the most disproportionately impacted by the changes in early voting locations in 2018, compared to 2014

Compared to urban voters, rural voters are more than 2 times as likely to be one mile or further away from their closest early voting location in 2018 (t1). Voters in the state's poorest counties are more than 3 times as likely as urban voters to be one mile or further away in 2018 (t2).

On average, rural voters overall are about 0.68 miles further away from their closest early voting location in 2018 (t3). That's almost four times the change in average distance for urban voters. And voters in the poorest counties are 1 mile further away from their closest site than in 2014, almost six times further away than voters in the wealthiest counties (t4).

On average, voters in the 70 counties that saw some change to their early voting locations in 2018 are about one-third of a mile further away from their closest polling place than they would have been in 2014 (t5).

Although voters of almost every racial and political group, on average, saw their early voting sites move further away, white and Republican voters appear to have been impacted slightly more.

White voters, on average, are 0.42 miles further away from sites in 2018 than they would have been in 2014. Black voters, by comparison, are now 0.28 miles further away on average (t6).

The average Republican voter is about 0.45 miles further away from an early voting location, compared to 0.31 miles further away for Democrats. Unaffiliated voters are on average about 0.34 miles further away (t7).

White and Republican voters are also slightly more likely than other groups to be further than a mile away from their closest early voting location in 2018 compared to 2014 (t8, t9).

Both Hispanic and non-Hispanic voters are, on average, a little further away from early voting sites in 2018 than 2014 (t14). The difference, however, is about 50 percent further for non-Hispanic voters. But both groups are almost as likely to be more than a mile further away from their 2018 early voting location, compared to 2014 (t15).

It's important to note that despite the changes, the State Board of Elections announced this week that early voting in 2018 already surpassed the number of ballots cast in 2014. And that was with six days of early voting left to go.

As of 3:30 p.m. Monday, about 1.23 million North Carolinians had cast their ballots in early voting. That's already 4.4 percent higher than the 1.17 million ballots cast during the entire early voting period in 2014.
